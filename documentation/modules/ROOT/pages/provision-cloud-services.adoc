= Provision Red Hat application services

== Goals of this lab

Globex decides to use Red Hat OpenShift API Management which is a fully Red Hat managed API traffic control and API program management solution that includes analytics, access control, developer workflows, and more. 

The API lifecycle tools such as API Designer and Service Registry provide a streamlined developer experience to design and manage API specifications and schemas, and manage and secure APIs for internal and external teams.

In this workshop, you will use the Red Hat OpenShift API Management Developer Sandbox, which is a trial environment for RHOAM, which provides you with a free 30-day trial environment allowing you to explore the benefits of the API management platform.

In this section of the lab, you will 

* Register for Red Hat OpenShift API Management Developer Sandbox
* Provision a Service Registry instance to host the API schemas


== Register for a Developer sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift API Management (RHOAM)

. Register for a RHOAM sandbox by clicking on the red *Launch your RHOAM OpenShift Developer Sandbox* button on the https://red.ht/rhoam-sandbox[Developer Sandbox use case activities page,role=external,window=_blank]. You are redirected to a login page. Login with the Red Hat account that you created in the previous step.
. You are redirected back to the Developer Sandbox use case activities page. To prevent the creation of fraudulent accounts, your sandbox account needs to be validated with a phone verification step.

. Once you enter the code received on your phone, your RHOAM sandbox will be ready to use. Click the *Start using your RHOAM sandbox* button.
. You are redirected to the Developer Sandbox login screen. Click the *DevSandbox* button to log into your OpenShift Sandbox.

. If this is the first time you use the Red Hat account on the Developer Sandbox, you are redirected to a Terms and Conditions page. Check the *I have read and agree to all the terms and conditions below* check box. Feel free to uncheck the *I would like to receive...* check boxes if you want to opt out from receiving marketing emails. Click *Submit*.
. The final step in the registration process is an email verification step. An email is sent to the email address attached to your Red Hat account, with a verification link. Access your email, open the email (the subject is `Verify email for Red Hat account` ), and copy the verification link.

. Go back to the browser tab which is open on the Developer Sandbox email verification page, and paste the link in the browser address bar. You are now redirected to the Developer perspective of your Developer Sandbox.
+

. An *OpenShift API Management tenant* has been preprovisioned for you within the *<username>-dev* namespace.
. To launch OpenShift API Management, select *Project* from the menu on the left, and in the *Launcher* pane on the right side, select *API Management*.

== Provision a Service Registry instance

In this step you provision a Service Registry trial instance on the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. The Service Registry instance will be used in this workshop to store OpenAPI spec documents.

. Navigate to https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com,role=external,window=_blank] and log in with your Red Hat account credentials.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you created a new Red Hat account as explained in the previous section, you should already be logged in into the Hybrid Cloud Console.
You will need to accept another set of terms and conditions in order to create a Service Registry instance.
====

. On the https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com] landing page, select *Application and Data Services* from the menu on the left.

. On the Application Services landing page, select *Service Registry → Service Registry Instances*.
+

. On the *Service Registry Instances* overview page, click the *Create Service Registry instance* button. Enter `globex` as the name of the instance and click *Create*. This starts the provisioning process for your Service Registry instance.

. The new Service Registry instance is listed in the instances table. After a couple of seconds, your instance should be marked as ready.
